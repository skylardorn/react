        Hi thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio, I hope you're enjoying it so far. A little bit about me is that I'm a family man. I enjoy spending time with them, especially when it is on the soccer field. If you can't tell from the header and the background of my portfolio, I grew up playing soccer with my dad who unfortunately is no longer with us, so, soccer helps me be reminded of him. However, if you are trying to reach out to me professionally you can just click on the contact section above and I will reach out once i recieve your information.
